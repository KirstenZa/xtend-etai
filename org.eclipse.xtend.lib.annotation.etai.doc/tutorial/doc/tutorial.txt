# ETAI Library - Tutorial

## Introduction

The ETAI library contains several [Active Annotations for Xtend](https://eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/204_activeannotations.html). The major purpose of the provided Active Annotations is to avoid boilerplate code by providing different means. These means include the automatic **extraction** of interfaces from classes, an extension mechanism for classes by methods of so-called **trait** classes, and the automatic **adaption** and **implementation** of methods and constructors in derived classes. Based on these keywords, this Active Annotation library is called ETAI.
