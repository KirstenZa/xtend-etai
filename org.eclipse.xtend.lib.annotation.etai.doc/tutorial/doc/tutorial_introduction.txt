## Introduction

The ETAI library contains several [Active Annotations for Xtend](https://eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/204_activeannotations.html). The major purpose of the provided Active Annotations is to avoid boilerplate code by providing different means. These means include the automatic **extraction** of interfaces from classes, an extension mechanism for classes by methods of so-called **trait** classes, and the automatic **adaption** and **implementation** of methods and constructors. Based on these keywords, this Active Annotation library is called ETAI.

### Usage

The easiest way to build the ETAI library is to use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). Necessary build files are already included in the repository. However, no wrapper is provided, so Gradle should be installed on your system.

The following sections will explain how to use Gradle in order to use the ETAI library.

#### Build and Use the Library

To perform a build it is enough to run the following command in the project's root directory. 

```shell
foo@bar:~$ gradle build
```

Afterwards, a JAR containing all necessary annotations is available:

```shell
org.eclipse.xtend.lib.annotation.etai/build/libs/org.eclipse.xtend.lib.annotation.etai-<version>.jar
```

This JAR can be added as dependency to an appropriate Xtend project in order to enable the active annotations and all features explained in this tutorial.

#### Test the Library

The ETAI library contains several test sets. All tests can be run via this command from the project's root directory:

```shell
foo@bar:~$ gradle test
```

The test report can be found here:

```shell
org.eclipse.xtend.lib.annotation.etai.tests/build/reports/tests/test/index.html
```

#### Setup for Eclipse

There is also the possibility to easily setup the configuration needed for opening and use the projects in the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/). Just use the following command from the project's root directory:

```shell
foo@bar:~$ gradle eclipse
```

Afterwards, it is possible to import the ETAI library projects into Eclipse via "Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace".

In order to play around just create another Xtend project, put project *org.eclipse.xtend.lib.annotation.etai* into its "Java Build Path" and all features shown in this tutorial can be used there.
